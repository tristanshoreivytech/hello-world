# hello-world
Hello, my name is Tristan Shore and I am from Indianapolis. My current degree is in Software Engineering. In the future, I'd love to work as a game developer or a web designer. My favorite things to do for fun is play games, watch anime, and occasionally writing. The games I like most are strategy games and platformer games. I think the module that would be the most fun to learn about is the one on Web Applications as I've already taken a course on web design, and I enjoyed taking that class.
